# Open Source Odyssey

Welcome to Open Source Odyssey, an event designed to foster open-source contributions and help participants improve their problem-solving, coding, and collaboration skills!

The goal is to solve these issues, contribute to this repository, and learn the best practices for open-source collaboration.

This repository contains a collection of website-related tasks divided into three categories based on their difficulty level:
- Easy
- Medium

### Follow these best practices when creating your PRs to maintain clarity and professionalism:
- **Link Issues**: Always link the issue you're working on in the PR description using keywords like **Fixes #issue-number**, Closes #issue-number, or Resolves #issue-number. [**MUST**]
- **Write Meaningful Titles**: Summarize the purpose of your PR in the title. Example: Add footer component for the homepage.
- **Provide Context**: Use the PR description to explain your changes, why they are necessary, and any relevant details.
- **Use Atomic Commits**: Break down your changes into small, logical commits with descriptive messages.
- **Follow Code Style Guidelines**: Ensure your code follows any style guides outlined in the project (e.g., linting rules).
- **Test Your Code**: Test your changes to confirm they work as expected.
- **Be Responsive**: Address feedback and requested changes from reviewers promptly and politely.
- **Keep PRs Focused**: Solve one issue or implement one feature per PR to make reviews easier.
